<h1 align="center"/>Welcome to defiant </h1>
Defiant is an open-source Telegram bot designed to automate tunneling between two Ubuntu servers and to install and manage VPN panels.
The main goal of this project is to simplify network setup processes, reduce manual errors, and speed up server deployment.

Defiant is completely free to use and not intended for sale or commercial purposes.
It provides an easy-to-use interface, automated command execution, and a streamlined setup experience.

This project is suitable for users who want to manage server tunneling and VPN panel installation without dealing with complex manual configurations.
Defiant is released as an open-source project, and contributions from the community are welcome.
